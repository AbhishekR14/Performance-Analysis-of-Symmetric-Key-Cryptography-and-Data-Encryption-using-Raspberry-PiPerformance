Majority of cloud storage servers use basic security techniques to store the data securely.
To add another level of security to the files stored on the cloud, we have used cryptographic techniques to encrypt the data before uploading it to the cloud storage server.
For the same, we have developed a personalized web server for offices and homes built on a Raspberry Pi that lets users encrypt their files, print and securely upload it on the cloud.Majority of cloud storage servers use basic security techniques to store the data securely.
